This is a projetc I am creating in Ruby in order to see what I can do with my newly acquired Ruby skills. In light of recent excitement in the world of Black gold I thought I would create an app that would provide insight to anyone with a  holding in the commodity.

I would like to integrate an API/'s. My thoughts now are using IGIndex for proces and potentially also use twitter to gain some kind of market insight based on tweets as to whether poeople believe it will fall further or the price will rebound.
