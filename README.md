### Oil Trader

This is a project I have decided to complete in order to use my skills I have attained from Makers Academy. I enjoy coding the back-end hence have decided to make a trading game to be played in the command line. I will be putting this onto a website using sinatra and heroku in due course. But currently this code showcases some of what I can do with plane old Ruby and Rspec.


### Tech
Ruby
Rspec


### How to use



Clone this repo:
```sh
$ git clone https://github.com/jamesascarter/OilTrader.git
```

Change into the directory:
```sh
$ cd OilTrader
```

To run the rspec tests:
```sh
$ rspec
```



To run the code:
```sh
$ irb
$ require './runner'
$ exchange = Exchange.new
$ James = Baron.new('James')
    
```

### Improvements currently working on:

* Add market crash event
* Use sinatra/heroku to make a web app
* Use database postgresql to store scores/player names.
